# #  python is an object oriented programming language.
# # almost everything in python is an object, with its probertis and methods.
# # A class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


# # to create class, use the keyword class:

# # Example : Create a class named MyClass, with property named x:

# class MyClass:
#     x = 5
#     print(x)

# p1 = MyClass()
# print(p1.x)

#  THE_INIT_() FUNCTION

# All classes hce a function called _init_(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

# Example create a class named person, use the _init_fun() to assign values for name and age

# class Person:

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name,
#         self.age = age

# p1 = Person("john", 36)

# print(p1.name)
# print(p1.age)

# class Person:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age
    
#     def myfunc(self):
#         print(f'Hello my name is {self.name} and my age is {self.age}')

# p1 = Person("John", 36)
# p1.name = 'sajan'
# p1.myfunc()


# class- template 
# object - instance of the class 







# class Student:
#     pass


# harry = Student()
# larry = Student()

# harry.name = 'harry'
# harry.std = 12
# harry.section =1

# print(harry.name)
